Description : This Python program helps you track student grades throughout a course. Here's a basic outline:
Data Storage:
Use dictionaries to store student information. Each key can be a student's ID, and the value can be another dictionary containing details like name, a list of grades for assignments/tests, and the overall average.
Adding Students:
Create a function to add new students. It prompts the user for the student's ID and name, creates a new dictionary entry, and initializes an empty list for grades.
Entering Grades:
Design a function to enter grades. It takes the student ID and assignment name as input. It retrieves the student's dictionary, validates the ID, and prompts for the grade. This grade is then appended to the student's grade list.
Calculating Averages:
Implement a function to calculate a student's average grade. It retrieves the student's dictionary and calculates the average of the grades in their list.
Viewing Information:
Develop a function to display a student's information. It takes the student ID and retrieves the corresponding dictionary. It then prints the student's name, all entered grades, and the calculated average.
Optional Features:
Enhance the program by allowing grade editing, deleting students, and calculating class averages.
Benefits:
This program simplifies grade tracking and provides easy access to student performance data.

Conclusion : This Python student grade tracker empowers you to manage student progress effectively. By leveraging dictionaries, you can effortlessly add students, record grades for assignments and tests, and calculate individual and potentially class averages. This eliminates the tedious task of manual record-keeping, allowing you to focus on what matters most â€“ providing insightful feedback and fostering student learning. Furthermore, the program's modular design using functions promotes code reusability and facilitates future enhancements. With additional features like grade editing, student deletion, or even generating reports, this program can transform into a comprehensive grade management system, saving valuable time and effort.
